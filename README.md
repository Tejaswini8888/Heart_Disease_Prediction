# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes such as:\
Age\
Sex\
Resting blood pressure\
Cholesterol\
Maximum heart rate\
Exercise-induced angina

### Target:

1 → Heart disease present

0 → No heart disease

## 🧠 What This Project Shows

Data loading & preprocessing\
Exploratory Data Analysis (Correlation Heatmap)\
Train/Test split\
Feature Scaling\
Classification using Random Forest

#### Model evaluation using:

Accuracy\
Confusion Matrix\
Classification Report

This is a highly valuable real-world ML project used in healthcare and fintech companies.
